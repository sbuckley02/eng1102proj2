        "name": "Shein",
        "description": "As Shein, you are a fast-growing online clothing retailer. While your website itself may seem sleek and clean, the unethical labor practices flip that image on its back. You are hesitant to be transparent with your customers, afraid of the consequences.",
        "note": "Shein is a perpetrator of fast fashion as it attempts to keep up with the latest fashion. However, Shein is also notoriously known for its cheap labor and more importantly child labor. Especially for harvesting crops, Shein's sources have been reported to employ children to pick the cotton for them.",

        "name": "H&M",
        "description": "As H&M, you cater to a wide variety of consumers ranging from adults to kids. With an emphasis on \"trendiness,\" you seek to keep up with all the new up-and-coming styles. However, this process leads to underpayment in workers to maintain profits and quite the amount of textile waste.",
        "note": "H&M has pledged to fix its manufacturing process in the future in order to meet sustainable and ethical goals. While they are moving forward, the pay for their workers still leaves a lot to be desired.",

    "zara": {
        "name": "Zara",
        "description": "As Zara, you always keep up with the latest trend and stay on top of the fashion line, but at what cost? Although it seems as though your stock is constant and thriving it makes you wonder about all the things that don't get sold.",
        "note": "Zara's marketing model shares a lot of similarities with that of fast fashion industries. This usually results in huge amounts of textile waste as well as enormous amounts of energy consumption. In addition, Zara had several occurrences of unpaid workers which led to messages being sewn into the clothing revealing their conditions.",

    "lulu": {
        "name": "Lululemon",
        "description": "As Lululemon, you are known for your very comfortable high-quality athletic clothing. However, the treatment of the people that make your clothing is not high-quality.",
        "note": "In the manufacturing factories, workers have claimed all sorts of problems ranging from harassment in the workplace to very low pay. Couple that with Lululemon sourcing their final production from third-world countries and you'll find that Lululemon is not as glamorous as it may seem.",

    "uniqlo": {
        "name": "Uniqlo",
        "description": "As Uniqlo, you are a relatively new brand hoping to make an unique impact on the market. You have grown in popularity due to your low cost and relatively high quality. However, to make up the low cost, you must balance this cost in other places.",
        "note": "Although moving in the right direction, Uniqlo still has some questionable problems. They have refused to release all of their suppliers and have not paid their severance package to workers, totaling up to $5.5 million.",

    "seafood": {
        "name": "seafood",
        "description": "As seafood, you provide excellent concentrations of nutrients, which is perfect for those who are looking to study or learn. However, the cost of procuring seafood results in your own school of fish suffering greatly from overfishing and giant nets getting lost in the ocean.",
        "note": "While it's harder said than done, you can still play your part by looking at the source of fish products. While farmed fish and wild fish both have their flaws, farmed fish play a less detrimental impact on marine ecosystems.",

    "coffee": {
        "name": "a coffee bean",
        "description": "As coffee beans, you enjoy sparking happiness in people's mornings. Yet, behind the scenes, harvesters toil both night and day without benefitting from the fruit of their labor. While you may bring energy to some people, there are others who are drained instead.",
        "note": "To combat forced labor that often plays a large role in coffee beans, look for the label \"Free Trade Coffee\". Although a more difficult task, buying coffee beans/grounds instead of buying straight from a coffee chain will help lessen the burden on coffee bean harvesters.",

        "name": "palm oil",
        "description": "As palm oil, you're the secret bedrock and driver of important processes. While maintaining the facade of a nice tropical plant and the icon of exquisite beaches and vacation areas, your harvesting process leaves these areas desert of the beautiful palm trees that once stood strong.",
        "note": "Palm oil is rapidly causing heavy deforestation, especially in southeast Asia. Instead of buying palm oil, search for alternatives such as coconut oil or rapeseed oil, which have similar properties to palm oil.",

    "chocolate": {
        "name": "chocolate",
        "description": "As chocolate, you're incredibly sweet, but with a twist. Although you spread joy across the world, the process of harvesting your ingredients leaves a bitter taste in the worker's mouths.",

        "note": "Despite its name, Himalayan salt is mined from quarries in Pakistan. They are unethically mined as they both release huge amounts of greenhouse emissions and they are mined by underpaid workers who climb into dirty mines to harvest these salt chunks.",

        "note": "Rubber trees are often grown in small villages in Asia and Africa. In order to meet the massive demands for rubber gloves and other rubber products, these small towns utilize child and underpaid labor to extract/process the rubber from the trees.",

        "description": "As a toy, you are seen as the embodiment of fun and enjoyment. However, to pump out the massive demand for toys, companies employ some tactics that are not entirely fun nor enjoyable.",
        "note": "This category is the most difficult to avoid when looking for ethically-produced products. Even popular game companies such as Hasbro have marks against them when it comes to forced/unjust labor. However, ethical alternatives to games like these are cards and online versions of board games.",
